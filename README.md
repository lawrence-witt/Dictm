## Requests and Bugs

If you come across any bugs or errors, please do let me know via the issues tab on this repository. I would also love to hear about any feature requests you might have for future versions of the application.

This project currently has a private dependency which is pending public release. Once all dependencies are made public, it will be possible to fork and rebuild the project yourself, at which point I would be happy to accept pull requests.
